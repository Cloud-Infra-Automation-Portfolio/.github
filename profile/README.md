## Cloud Infrastructure Automation Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on cloud infrastructure automation projects demonstrating how to provision, configure and operate cloud environments reliably using infrastructure-as-code and automation tooling.

The projects focus on IaC, CI/CD pipelines, configuration management, monitoring and policy enforcement across AWS and Azure, reflecting real-world cloud operations and platform engineering practices.
